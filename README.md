A unifying typeclass describing collections and higher-order data transformation and manipulation actions common to a wide variety of data processing tasks. Inspired by the Scala collections API.

##### ALPHA WARNING
This work is ongoing. This codebase is continually evolving; APIs break constantly. It should not be relied upon (yet!).

Use Cases
=========

Write an algorithm that works on a generic collection (fif.Data) and be able to instantly re-use your code to scale from local Scala collections to massively distributed Spark RDDs or Flink DataSet instances.
